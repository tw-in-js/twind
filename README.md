Twind is a small compiler that converts utility classes into CSS at runtime. The goal of this project is to unify the flexibility of CSS-in-JS with the carefully considered constraints of the Tailwind API.

Utility-first CSS without any build step right in the browser or any other environment like Node.js, deno, workers, ...

## ✨ Features

**⚡️ No build step**

Get all the benefits of Tailwind without the need for Tailwind, PostCSS, configuration, purging, or autoprefixing.

**🚀 Framework agnostic**

If your app uses HTML and JavaScript, it should work with Twind. This goes for server-rendered apps too.

Twind ships the compiler, not the CSS. This means unlimited styles and variants for one low fixed cost.

### 💡 Inspiration

It would be untrue to suggest that the design here is totally original. Other than the founders' initial attempts at implementing such a module ([oceanwind](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/oceanwind) and [beamwind](https://github.com/kenoxa/beamwind)) we are truly standing on the shoulders of giants.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): created a wonderfully thought out API on which the compiler's grammar was defined.
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/): implemented and popularized the advantages of doing CSS-in-JS.
- [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm): a JSX compiler that proved there is merit in doing runtime compilation of DSLs like JSX.
- [goober](https://github.com/cristianbote/goober): an impossibly small yet efficient CSS-in-JS implementation that defines critical module features.
- [otion](https://github.com/kripod/otion): the first CSS-in-JS solution specifically oriented around handling CSS in an atomic fashion.
- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx): a tiny utility for constructing class name strings conditionally.
- [style-vendorizer](https://github.com/kripod/style-vendorizer): essential CSS prefixing helpers in less than 1KB of JavaScript.
- [UnoCSS](https://github.com/antfu/unocss): for the configuration syntax.
- [CSSType](https://github.com/frenic/csstype): providing autocompletion and type checking for CSS properties and values.
