  https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/issues/238#issuecomment-1021544996

  ```js
  // using a mutation observer?
  document.querySelectorAll('style[type~="twind/css"]').forEach((e) => {
    tw(css(e.textContent))
  })
  ```

- zero runtime
  - safelist, extractor, examples
- a package to make it easy to create lightweight versions of presets (like https://lodash.com/custom-builds)
- postcss plugin like tailwindcss for SSR

  ```css
  @twind;
  ```

- `ensure`: like setup but keeps track of presets and merges them

  ```js
  // package a
  import { ensure } from '@twind/core'
  ensure(presetTailwind())

  // package b
  import { ensure } from '@twind/core'
  ensure(presetTailwind(), presetTailwindForms())
  ```

## v2

- fully typed theme
